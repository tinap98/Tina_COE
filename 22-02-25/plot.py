4. This indicates that most products or customers fall into the Low Consumption category, while High Consumption is less frequent.

3. Medium Consumption (green) is concentrated between 11 and 14.

### Balanced Distribution Across Quantity:

1. The Quantity values seem to be fairly evenly distributed across the three consumption levels.
2. There are no extreme skews or clear separations among the classes.

### Consumption Levels Overlap:

1. The three consumption categories (Low, Medium, High) show overlapping density curves.
2. This suggests that Quantity alone might not be a strong differentiator for Consumption_Level.

### Possible Trends in KDE Curves:

1. The Low Consumption (blue line) appears more frequent at lower quantity values.
2. The Medium Consumption (orange line) is spread across the middle.
3. The High Consumption (green line) has peaks toward the higher quantity values.

    2. Medium Consumption makes up about 33.7%.
    3. High Consumption is the smallest group at 26.5%.

## Key Insights:
#### Higher Quantity Average:

1. The Quantity Average is significantly higher than the Consumption Average for all three cities.
2. This suggests that while consumption values are relatively low, the total quantity available or used is much larger.

#### Similar Trends Across Cities:

1. All three cities (Chicago, Los Angeles, New York) show very similar values for both metrics.
2. There is no major disparity between them, indicating uniform consumption and quantity patterns.

#### Slight Variation in Consumption Average:

1. New York has the highest Consumption Average, followed closely by Los Angeles and Chicago.
2. However, the differences are minimal, meaning that consumption per unit (or per capita) is fairly consistent.

#### Implication of the Trends:

1. The high quantity average might indicate a large supply base or distribution network.
2. The relatively lower consumption average suggests that not all available quantity is being consumed.

    -> The counts are almost equal across all dealers, ranging around 1780 to 1792.
    -> There is no significant variation, meaning all dealers have approximately the same level of activity.
    -> This suggests a well-distributed dataset where each dealer has nearly identical transaction or sales counts.
2. Pie Chart (Right)
    -> This pie chart confirms the equal distribution seen in the bar chart.

    -> The slice labeled D003 is slightly larger (10.1%) and is also "exploded" for emphasis.

### Key Takeaways
    -> Balanced Distribution: Both quantity and consumption are uniformly distributed across all dealers.
    -> No Major Outliers: The differences are minimal, meaning all dealers contribute equally to the dataset.
    -> D004 leads in Quantity, while D009 leads in Consumption, but the differences are not significant

        ### Insights on the Above Plot
#### The image is a horizontal bar chart visualizing the count of different Product IDs (P000 to P019).

### Observations

### Gradient-Based Distribution:

1. The chart uses a dark-to-light gradient to represent the count.
2. P000 has the lowest count, while P019 has the highest count.
3. The values increase progressively from P000 to P019.

### Uniform Growth:

1. The counts seem to increase in a nearly linear fashion.
2. No major spikes or dips, suggesting a consistent trend.

### Top vs. Bottom Products:

1. P019, P018, and P017 have the highest counts.
2. P000, P001, and P002 have the lowest counts.
3. This might indicate that newer or more popular products have higher demand.

### Key Takeaways
1. Steady Demand Increase: Product counts increase systematically from P000 to P019, hinting at a possible product lifecycle trend.
2. Even Distribution: No major fluctuations indicate a controlled distribution process.
3. Market Trend? The higher count for later product IDs suggests they could be newer, better-performing, or more in demand.''')

        ### Insights on the Above Plot
### This horizontal bar chart compares three key metrics for each Product ID (P000 to P019):

### Quantity (Blue)
1. Consumption (Red)
2. Quantity-to-Consumption Ratio (Yellow)
3. Observations

### Quantity is significantly higher than Consumption:

1. The blue bars (Quantity) dominate the chart, meaning more products are available than consumed.
2. This might indicate overproduction, stockpiling, or lower demand for certain products.

### Consumption is much lower:
1. The red bars (Consumption) are relatively short, suggesting only a small portion of the available quantity is actually used.
2. This pattern is consistent across all products.

### Quantity-to-Consumption Ratio (Yellow) is minimal:

1. The yellow bars are very short, meaning the ratio is low.
2. This means a large gap exists between production (or stock) and actual usage.
3. High ratios could indicate wastage, inefficiency, or poor demand forecasting.

### Consistent Trends Across Products:

1. The same trend is observed across all Product IDs.
2. No significant outliers, meaning the imbalance is a systematic issue rather than a product-specific one.

### Key Takeaways
✔ Potential Overstocking: Since Quantity >> Consumption, there could be excess inventory.
✔ Inefficiency in Demand Planning: A low consumption rate suggests demand is lower than expected.
✔ Opportunity to Optimize Production & Distribution: Reducing quantity or boosting consumption strategies (e.g., marketing, promotions) could help balance supply and demand.''')
